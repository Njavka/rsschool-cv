## About Me

I'm 43 and I am a freelance translator from English into Russian, working mostly in IT, but also in medicine, technology, and science. I've always been fond of anything related to computers and electronics: PC architecture, Computer Science, and programming. I assembled all my PCs myself, starting with my first Intel 80386-based PC in 1997 and continuing to my current configuration based on the 12400f CPU.

Since my teenage years and up until now, I have been eager to create functional code, and I am passionate about becoming a programmer to gain real commercial experience.

## Code Example

This is one of my solutions from Codewars:

1. Your are given a string.
2. You must replace any occurence of the sequence coverage by covfefe, however, if you don't find the word coverage in the string, you must add covfefe at the end of the string with a leading space.

```javascript
function covfefe(str){
if(!str.includes('coverage')){
return str + ' covfefe';}
else{
  return str.replace(/coverage/g,'covfefe');}
  
}
```
